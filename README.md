**Setup and Installation**
Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine.

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-resume-generator.git
cd ai-resume-generator
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's best practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

Bash

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the following command:

Bash

pip install Flask google-generativeai reportlab Pillow
4. Set Your API Key
This project requires a Google AI API key to function.

Get your free API key from Google AI Studio.

Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. This is a secure way to handle your key without hardcoding it.

On Windows (Command Prompt):

DOS

set GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
On macOS/Linux:

Bash

export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Note: You must set this variable every time you open a new terminal session, or add it to your shell's startup file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc).

5. Run the Application
With your environment set up and the API key configured, run the Flask app:

Bash

python app.py
The application will start, and you'll see a message in the terminal indicating it's running, usually on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
